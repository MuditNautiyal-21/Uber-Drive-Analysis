# 🚗 Uber Drive Analysis – Exploratory Data Insights & Visual Storytelling

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores patterns in Uber driving behavior using a real-world dataset containing trip records, locations, categories, and timestamps. It aims to uncover driver habits, peak demand periods, and inefficiencies using **data cleaning, EDA, and visualization**.

---

## 📦 Dataset Summary
- Total Records: ~1,150+ Uber trips  
- Columns: `START_DATE`, `END_DATE`, `CATEGORY`, `START`, `STOP`, `MILES`, `PURPOSE`  
- Source: Personal ride log dataset (publicly available via Kaggle)

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand **trip behavior** by location, time, and purpose  
- Identify **patterns of usage** — working hours vs personal trips  
- Reveal **peak zones** and **frequent routes**  
- Use visualizations to derive **business-relevant insights**

---

## 🛠️ Techniques Used
- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Handled null `PURPOSE` values
  - Removed rows with missing timestamps
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Extracted `day`, `month`, `hour`, and `weekday` from timestamps
- **EDA**:
  - Trip distribution by category (Business vs Personal)
  - Purpose-based trip frequency
  - Most visited start/stop locations
  - Time-based ride patterns

## 📊 Visual Insights

| Insight | Visualization |
|--------|---------------|
| 🔹 Most Frequent Trip Purpose | Bar chart of `PURPOSE` count |
| 📍 Top Start & Stop Locations | Count plots & maps |
| 🕒 Trips by Hour & Weekday | Heatmaps and line charts |
| 📅 Monthly Ride Trends | Calendar heatmap / Time series |
| 🚦 Work vs Personal Balance | Category pie chart |

> Used `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, and `Plotly` for rich interactive and static visuals.

## 💡 Key Findings

- 🚕 Majority of rides are **Business** related (~70%)
- 🏢 Most frequent **start and stop locations** are Office/Consulting locations
- 🕒 Peak ride hours are **early morning and early evening**
- 📆 Weekdays (esp. Wednesday & Thursday) show the highest ride density
- 📍 Repeated trip patterns indicate potential for **route optimization**
